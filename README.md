Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ 
  I'm a student currently pursuing my degree in Computer Science, and this repository is a collection of projects and assignments I've worked on throughout my academic journey.
You'll find the work organized by language:
  C
  Java
  Python

These projects reflect the progression of my learning, from basic syntax to more structured problem-solving. While the code may not always be perfect or the most optimized, it is 95% written by me, based on my understanding and personal effort.

I started from scratch â€” no prior experience â€” and have taught myself everything along the way. The theoretical foundation and syntax are based on university lectures and lab work, but the ability to think through a problem, design a solution, and structure the code is something Iâ€™ve developed by actively using tools like ChatGPT and Stack Overflow â€” not to copy code, but to understand concepts and apply them in my own way.

This archive serves both as a reference in my CV and as a reflection of how far I've come through self-study, persistence, and curiosity. I'm proud of what I've built, and I'm always striving to learn and improve.

Thanks for checking out my work! ðŸ˜Š
